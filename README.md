# dbd-hosts-file-overrides
Simplest method to change DBD regions without using scripts.

## Changing regions
1. Backup your `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` by copying it anywhere else.
2. [Download the zip](https://github.com/snoggles/dbd-hosts-file-overrides/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) of region-specific hosts files.
3. Copy the `hosts` file for your target region over top of `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
4. Restart Dead by Daylight.

## Selecting Default region
Change back to the default region the same way.
1. Copy your backup `hosts` file or [default/hosts](default/hosts) over top of `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
2. Restart Dead by Daylight.
